# TCboard

## A TCG marketplace for player to player open trading.

TradingCardboard is a marketplace for trading card game players to list their collection and do trading between players, TCboard is the only place where trades can be done in cash, cards, or both.

The current mainstream marketplaces for trading cards - tcgplayer.com, cardmarket.com, and cardtrader.com only provide a distribution service for players to buy cards from other card stores with money, and don't allow players to buy from eachother, or even trade cards. This causes card prices to be inflated as stores have very thin margins and players have to use improvised communities like FaceBook and Discord to be able to conduct trades.

A lot of artists often do 'card alters' where they paint over the stock picture of a trading card, and these often have a lot of value, TCboard will also provide a centralised way for artists to upload their artwork and sell these as well.


> ## R7	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

The mainstream trading card marketplaces only allow players to buy from established card stores, and don't allow players to buy from eachother. This makes it unnecessarily difficult for players to trade cards between eachother without buying with money. TCboard solves this problem by allowing player-to-player transactions easily done without any money needed. Users can upload a list of their collections of cards they own, and will create a wishlist of cards they want. Then they can search for the cards they want that other users have, and can see that other user's wishlist as well, and so can make trading offers with cards from their inventory.

> ## R8	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Trading card games have become more expensive than ever, and this is primarily due to some element of the reckless monetary speculation on useless but unique stuff in the modern economy. TCboard aims to bring the trading experience back into trading card games so that players can save money and enjoy the games without needing to spend so much money.
